# Spec lifecycle and pruning

Akita accumulates design specs in `specs/`. Without pruning, the directory drifts
into a mix of live design, shipped-and-forgotten records, and contradictory
historical snapshots.

**Canonical policy:** [`docs/documentation.md`](../docs/documentation.md) (per-PR
obligations, hard CI checks, blast-radius PR comments).

**Narrative home:** the [Akita Book](../book/README.md). Once durable content is
folded into a book chapter, the spec is reference-only and must be archived.

## Three layers (no duplication)

| Layer | Role | Update when |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **Book** | Explanations readers consume | Behavior or architecture is stable enough to teach |
| **Specs** | Design records + acceptance criteria | Designing, implementing, or auditing a change |
| **AGENTS.md / docs/** | Agent contracts, graphs, generated tables | Verifier-reachable contracts or repo structure changes |

Do not maintain the same fact in two places. The book wins for narrative; specs win
for in-flight acceptance criteria until fold.

## Status vocabulary (exactly one per spec)

Every spec header uses **one** of these values (see `specs/TEMPLATE.md`):

| Status | Meaning | Location | Next step |
|--------|---------|----------|-----------|
| `proposed` | Not approved | `specs/` | Review or delete |
| `approved` | `spec-approved`, not started | `specs/` | Implement |
| `active` | Implementation in flight | `specs/` | Land PRs; check acceptance criteria |
| `implemented` | Shipped; retained in the root only when it remains load-bearing | `specs/` | Fold into book, then archive when safe |
| `superseded` | Replaced (`Superseded-by:` set) | `specs/archive/` | Do not edit for current behavior |
| `historical` | Retrospective only | `specs/archive/` | Do not edit |
| `archived` | Folded into book | `specs/archive/` | Edit book chapter instead |

**Ambiguity removed:**

- `implemented` **≠** `archived`. Shipped work stays in `specs/` until its
  durable content is folded into the book (or explicitly marked reference-only
  with no fold planned).
- `active` and `approved` must not describe merged work that has no unresolved
  acceptance criteria. Keep `active` only when the record still owns current
  behavior or has explicit follow-up work; put the reason in the summary.
- `proposed` on a fully checked acceptance list is a **process violation** (CI
  blast-radius + reviewer duty).
- Status values are exact. Progress notes, PR history, and implementation
  details belong in the other header fields or the body, not in `Status:`.

Target steady state: **≤15** specs in `specs/` root with status
`proposed` / `approved` / `active` / `implemented`. Everything else is archived.
The current set temporarily contains 20. The active external-catalog record,
the paired quotient-free tail-ring design and implementation records, and the
Jolt field-unification and guided-adaptation records account for the five-record
overage. Each record returns to the archive after its durable contract is folded
into the Book.

## Status transitions (required actions)

| Event | Author must |
|-------|-------------|
| Spec approved for implementation | `Status: approved` (or `active` when work starts) |
| Implementation PR merges | `Status: implemented`, `PR:` set, acceptance boxes checked |
| Durable content folded into book | `Book-chapter:` set to real path; `git mv` to `specs/archive/<quarter>/`; row in `specs/archive/README.md` |
| New spec replaces old | Old: `Status: superseded`, `Superseded-by:`; new: `Supersedes:` |
| Spec wrong but historically useful | `Status: historical`; archive without book fold |

## Staleness signals

1. **Status drift** — header disagrees with merged reality.
2. **Dead symbols** — cites removed crates/APIs (`akita-scheme`, `PlannerConfig`,
   `schedule_policy.rs`, `_with_policy`, …). CI scans **live specs** via
   `scripts/check-spec-references.sh` (see script for the current live list).
3. **Contradiction with `AGENTS.md`** — architecture index wins for current structure.
4. **Superseded** — newer spec covers the same ground (link both directions).
5. **Folded** — `Book-chapter:` set and chapter prose landed → archive the spec.

Run `scripts/check-spec-references.sh --all` quarterly on the full non-archive tree.

### Live specifications

The root live set is deliberately small and is synchronized with
`book/src/foundations/spec-index.md` and `scripts/check-spec-references.sh`:

1. `akita-compute-backend-metal.md`
2. `quotient-free-tail-ring-relations.md`
3. `quotient-free-tail-ring-relations-implementation.md`
4. `dyadic-chunk-partition.md`
5. `external-schedule-catalog-ownership.md`
6. `flat-public-matrix-and-exact-ntt-cache.md`
7. `fold-linf-rejection.md`
8. `heterogeneous-group-source-contracts.md`
9. `jolt-field-unification.md`
10. `large-digit-ntt-infrastructure.md`
11. `packed-sumcheck.md`
12. `role-native-projected-digit-layout.md`
13. `runtime-ring-cutover.md`
14. `selective-l2-fold-security-sizing.md`
15. `setup-offloading-planner.md`
16. `sis-quantum128-scalar-n-table.md`
17. `structured-e-term.md`
18. `subring-coefficient-packing.md`
19. `transcript-grinding.md`
20. `guided-schedule-adaptation.md`

All 20 current live specifications must pass the default dead-symbol scan. A record
that still contains a historical API name must either describe it explicitly as
a historical snapshot or be repaired before it is added to the live set.

## Cadence

| When | What |
|------|------|
| **Every PR** | Update spec headers if applicable; review blast-radius comment (`<!-- akita-doc-blast-radius -->`); keep hard checks green |
| **Monthly (~15 min)** | Run `./scripts/check-doc-guardrails.sh`; run `check-spec-references.sh --all`; triage false negatives in `docs/doc-blast-radius.json` |
| **Quarterly** | Execute an audit slice below; fold + archive; refresh `book/src/foundations/spec-index.md` |

## Archive layout

```
specs/archive/
  README.md          # index: filename | final status | book chapter | date
  2026-Q2/
    planner-refactor.md
    ...
```

Archiving = `git mv` + archive index row + fix inbound links + update book spec index.

## Folding into the book

1. Extract durable concepts (invariants, diagrams, formulas, contracts). Omit PR
   narration and execution checklists unless they are the contract.
2. Land book prose (or stub refresh with accurate sources) in the owning chapter.
3. Set `Book-chapter:` to a path under `book/src/` that **exists** (CI checks this).
4. Archive the spec in the same PR or the immediately stacked follow-up.

### Book chapter paths (consolidated outline)

Use these targets (not the pre-consolidation folder paths):

| Spec topic | Book chapter |
|------------|--------------|
| PCS decomposition / crate map | `book/src/how/architecture.md` |
| Optimized verifier | `book/src/how/verification.md` |
| Extension opening batching | `book/src/how/proving/extension-opening-reduction.md` |
| Sparse challenges | `book/src/how/proving/root-fold-ring-switch.md` |
| Terminal fold | `book/src/how/recursion.md` |
| Weak binding / norm fix | `book/src/how/security.md` |
| SIS consolidation | `book/src/how/security.md` |
| Planner refactor | `book/src/how/configuration.md` |
| Transcript hardening | `book/src/how/transcript.md` |
| Security hardening / no-panic | `book/src/how/verification.md` |
| remove-fp16 | `book/src/foundations/rings-and-fields.md` |
| CRT accumulation | `book/src/how/optimizations.md` |
| SIMD / fp31 | `book/src/how/optimizations.md` |
| ZK hiding specs | `book/src/roadmap/zero-knowledge.md` |
| Profiling / CI timing | `book/src/usage/profiling.md` |
| w-to-e notation | `book/src/foundations/glossary.md` |
| Setup product sumcheck | `book/src/how/proving/sumcheck-stages.md` |

## 2026-Q3 stale-spec removal (deleted, not archived)

The Q2 audit classified a large backlog for a stacked follow-up that never
landed, so the specs kept accumulating dead references. This pass **deleted**
21 specs outright rather than archiving them: each was either superseded by a
spec that already owns the content, a retrospective of shipped work, or a
shipped change whose header still read `proposed` / `draft` / `in review`. None
carried durable content that the book or a surviving spec did not already own.

Recovery is via git history (`git log --diff-filter=D -- specs/`), not the
archive.

### Superseded or abandoned (successor owns the content)

| Deleted spec | Content now owned by |
|--------------|----------------------|
| `distributed-verifier-row-eval.md` | `digit-innermost-layout.md` (PR #296 closed unlanded) |
| `akita-sumcheck-unification.md` | `archive/2026-Q3/digit-range-pipeline-refactor.md` |
| `schedule-catalog-ownership.md` | `heterogeneous-group-source-contracts.md` |
| `transcript-immediate-fixes.md` | `book/src/how/transcript.md` |
| `batched-stage3-setup-opening.md` | `archive/2026-Q3/group-local-opening-points.md` |
| `extension-field-trace-cutover.md` | `extension-field-opening-batching.md` |
| `fp16-small-field-support.md` | `remove-fp16.md` |
| `crt-ntt-prime-profiles.md` | `book/src/foundations/ntt-crt.md` |

### Retrospectives of shipped work (no forward value)

`fp31-field-optimization-retrospective.md`,
`small-field-prover-opening-optimization.md`,
`akita-crate-followup-jolt-integration.md`,
`core-protocol-naming-cleanup.md` (superseded by archived `w-to-e-notation.md`),
`general-field-support.md`, `extension-claim-incidence-cutover.md`,
`simd-ring-subfield-fp8.md`.

### Status drift (PR merged; header still open)

| Deleted spec | Header said | Shipped in |
|--------------|-------------|------------|
| `shared-opening-claims-api.md` | `proposed` | landed; `OpeningClaimsLayout` / `PolynomialGroupLayout` are the live types |
| `transcript-hardening.md` | `DRAFT` | PR #90 |
| `y-ring-trace-internalization.md` | `in review` | PR #154 |
| `ring-dim-challenge-cutover.md` | `draft` | PR #268 |
| `sis-infinity-estimator-crate.md` | `proposed` | `crates/akita-sis-estimator/` |
| `single-point-opening-batch.md` | landed PR #186 | superseded by archived `group-local-opening-points.md` |

### 2026-Q3 cleanup applied

The shipped records whose durable content is now in the Book are archived and
indexed in [`specs/archive/README.md`](archive/README.md). Superseded planner,
layout, and setup records point to their current owners from the archive.

The following four obsolete records were deleted after their current content was
replaced by the Book or newer live specifications:

- `distributed-planner.md`
- `distributed-prover.md`
- `mixed-ring-dimension-per-level.md`
- `recursive-mixed-ring-dimension-performance.md`

The historical CPU-heavy Metal cutover was archived separately from the active
Metal-track spec. The root now contains the 14 live records listed above, plus
policy and support files.

### Root policy and support files

`TEMPLATE.md`, `SPEC_REVIEW.md`, and this file are policy/support documents.
They are not part of the 15-spec live set and are never archived with design
records.

## Never commit / never fold

Root-level `*-NEVER-COMMIT.md` scratch files are local-only.
