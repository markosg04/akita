## Summary

Akita's public commitment matrices are mathematically one deterministic stream
of base-field elements. A schedule gives a finite prefix of that stream a ring
dimension and a matrix shape. The current implementation instead gives setup a
global generation ring dimension, derives the XOF in chunks of that dimension,
rounds setup capacity into those chunks, restricts every scheduled ring
dimension to a divisor of that setup dimension, and prepares full-capacity NTT
caches in both transform domains for every dimension and compute cluster that
is warmed. These are accidental couplings between protocol identity, storage,
schedule geometry, and backend optimization.

This spec makes the public matrix a dimension-free, prefix-compatible field
stream. A materialized setup is an exact cached prefix of that stream. Ring
dimensions exist only on schedule-owned matrix views and arithmetic operations.
Power-of-two zero padding exists only in protocol objects whose semantics call
for zero padding. A setup-prefix commitment is different: its complete
power-of-two domain is an actual prefix of the random public stream, while its
setup-index weight is zero outside the natural support. NTT caches are derived backend state, independently sized
for each ring dimension, transform domain, operation cluster, and exactness
profile. Their sizes are compiled from the concrete operations that will use
them, not from the total materialized setup capacity.

This is an intentional protocol and cache-format cutover. Public-matrix
coefficients, transcript descriptors, serialized setup bytes, and disk cache
keys change. Akita has no backward-compatibility requirement, so this stacked follow-up must
perform the full cutover and invalidate old setup caches rather than preserve a
generation-D compatibility path.

## Intent

### Goal

Give setup one durable meaning: a deterministic public field stream plus an
exact materialized prefix. Derive all ring-shaped matrix views, setup-offload
objects, and backend transform caches from that object under explicit,
schedule-owned geometry.

### Normative language

The words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **SHOULD**, and **MAY** are normative. A
statement about current behavior is descriptive only when it appears under
"Current implementation."

### Conceptual model

The system has four layers. They are deliberately separate.

```text
semantic public parameters
    AkitaSetupSeed = derivation algorithm + public seed
    S_F,id : nonnegative field index -> F
                         |
                         | exact prefix [0, capacity_fields)
                         v
operational setup materialization
    PublicMatrixPrefix<F> = id + Vec<F>
                         |
                         | schedule-owned reshape of an exact prefix
                         v
protocol matrix use
    MatrixView = (ring dimension, rows, columns)
    fields used = ring dimension * rows * columns
                         |
                         | backend-local derived representations
                         v
execution caches
    NTT prefixes by (cluster, ring dimension, transform domain, profile)
```

Only the first and third layers affect proof meaning. Materialization length
and cache contents are local capacity and performance choices.

### Durable objects and ownership

The exact Rust spelling may follow crate conventions, but the final object
model MUST preserve these responsibilities. It MUST NOT collapse them back into
one setup seed or one carrier dimension.

#### Public matrix identity

`AkitaSetupSeed` identifies the infinite deterministic stream. Its semantic
fields are:

```rust
pub struct AkitaSetupSeed {
    pub derivation: PublicMatrixDerivation,
    pub seed: [u8; 32],
}

pub enum PublicMatrixDerivation {
    Shake256PagedV1,
}
```

The enum is protocol identity, not a compatibility shim. It prevents an
implementation detail such as XOF page size or field sampling from changing
silently. The base field is already bound by the algebra section and Rust type,
so it need not be duplicated in this value.

`AkitaSetupSeed` MUST NOT contain:

- a ring dimension;
- a matrix row count or width;
- `max_num_vars` or a batch limit;
- a materialized prefix length;
- a config type, preset name, or schedule digest.

#### Materialized public matrix

The expanded coefficient object is logically:

```rust
pub struct PublicMatrixPrefix<F> {
    pub id: AkitaSetupSeed,
    coefficients: Vec<F>,
}
```

Its capacity is exactly `coefficients.len()` base-field elements. It has no
generation dimension and no ring-element length. It MAY expose a checked method
equivalent to:

```rust
fn matrix_view<const D: usize>(
    &self,
    rows: usize,
    columns: usize,
) -> Result<RingMatrixView<'_, F, D>, AkitaError>;
```

The method computes `required = rows * columns * D` with checked arithmetic,
requires `required <= coefficients.len()`, and reshapes
`coefficients[..required]`. The entire stored vector need not be divisible by
`D`. There MUST NOT be a whole-envelope `total_ring_elements_at(D)` contract.

#### Provisioning limits

`max_num_vars` and `max_num_batched_polys` are host admission and provisioning
limits. They determine which catalog schedules and setup-prefix slots a setup
package promises to cover. They MAY remain metadata on the prover/verifier
setup package, but they MUST NOT be part of `AkitaSetupSeed`, public-matrix
derivation, or transcript identity.

The canonical physical capacity unit is a base-field element count. The setup
API and config API MUST expose that unit directly. A ring-element
`SetupMatrixEnvelope { max_setup_len }` is not part of the target model.

#### Derived setup artifacts

Setup-prefix commitments are preprocessing artifacts derived from a public
matrix ID, a natural weight support, its canonical full power-of-two source
prefix, and commitment parameters. They remain in
prover and verifier registries. They do not change the identity or storage
shape of the base public matrix.

Backend-prepared NTT data is not part of `AkitaProverSetup`,
`AkitaVerifierSetup`, equality, serialization, or transcript identity.

### Setup provenance and validation

Akita has transparent public parameters. There is no secret ceremony output to
trust. This does not mean that arbitrary serialized setup artifacts are safe to
accept. A verifier must distinguish three separate claims:

1. `AkitaSetupSeed` names the intended deterministic stream under the intended
   field and derivation version.
2. A setup-prefix commitment is the exact commitment to the stated full
   power-of-two prefix of that stream, with the stated active support and
   commitment parameters.
3. The bytes loaded by this process are the same bytes that previously passed
   the required validation.

The first claim follows from protocol identity. The second is a derivation
claim and needs computation or a proof. The third is an artifact authentication
claim. A checksum only detects accidental corruption. A pinned digest or
signature authenticates bytes, but it inherits the trust placed in whoever
validated and authenticated those bytes. Package authentication is therefore
an allowed deployment mechanism, not the final transparent provenance model.

Direct validation derives the public stream and recomputes the commitment. It
can use bounded working memory, but its time is linear in the full prefix.
Random spot checks do not prove equality of a commitment to the complete
prefix. Random linear checks also do not avoid reading the complete SHAKE
stream unless an additional authenticated algebraic structure is introduced.
Independent recomputations improve operational assurance, but they do not
change the statement that the verifier itself has checked.

The target compact validation mechanism is a certificate chain. For every
setup-prefix slot `i`, a certificate proves this statement:

```text
C_i = Commit(
    S_F,id[0 .. n_prefix_i],
    slot_id_i.commitment_params
)
```

The certified transcript MUST bind at least:

- the field and complete `AkitaSetupSeed`;
- the certificate protocol version and domain separator;
- the exact bytes or a cryptographic canonical digest of `C_i`;
- the complete slot ID, active support, full-prefix length, and commitment
  parameters;
- the predecessor and successor certificate identities when this is a chained
  level.

A certificate MAY use a smaller setup-prefix commitment `C_(i+1)` as the
preprocessed setup for checking the proof about `C_i`. The proof at level `i`
must establish the complete derivation statement above, while the next level
establishes the corresponding statement for `C_(i+1)`. Every step MUST
strictly reduce the natural prefix that remains to be checked. The final
certificate MUST end at a small prefix that the validator derives directly
from `AkitaSetupSeed`. This terminal direct check is the cryptographic trust
anchor. A release signature, protected local key, or pinned package digest may
authenticate an already validated package for fast restart, but none of them
replaces this derivation chain in the transparent model.

The lifecycle has three distinct phases:

1. A setup builder materializes large prefixes, computes commitments, and
   produces any validation certificates.
2. Setup installation or first use validates the direct prefix or certificate
   chain and constructs `ValidatedVerifierSetup` state.
3. Per-proof verification accepts only validated state. It MUST NOT rescan a
   large public prefix, parse an unvalidated registry, or validate the full
   certificate chain on the proof hot path.

Persisting a marker that says "validated" is sufficient only when the host can
protect that marker and bind it to the exact package bytes. If an attacker can
replace both the package and marker, startup must revalidate, verify an
authenticated package digest, or verify the certificate chain.

This PR does not choose the concrete certificate proof system. Akita recursion,
a specialized algebraic proof, and another succinct proof system are all
possible. The choice requires a measured comparison of certificate size,
builder time, installation time, terminal direct-prefix size, implementation
complexity, and recursion assumptions. This PR fixes the statement, bindings,
trust anchor, and lifecycle so that this later choice cannot weaken
provenance or move setup work into per-proof verification.

#### Current implementation boundary

The public-matrix disk cache checks its identity, shape, field encoding, and
every coefficient against the deterministic stream when it is loaded. The
setup-prefix registry checks encoding, identity, geometry, and required-slot
completeness. It does not currently recompute each stored commitment or verify
a derivation certificate. The current registry is therefore structurally
validated, not fully provenance validated.

The compact `ValidatedVerifierSetup` boundary and certificate chain are
explicitly deferred. Until they exist, a deployment that loads a persisted
setup-prefix registry must either recompute its commitments from the public
stream or state the operational trust root that authenticated the package. The
implementation and documentation MUST NOT describe structural registry checks
alone as semantic validation.

### Large materializations and resource policy

The public stream has no protocol length ceiling. The current paged derivation
encodes the page index as `u64`, and serialized lengths use checked `u64`
encoding. Ten billion field elements do not approach that index space. The
Rust materialization APIs currently use `usize`, so multi-gigabyte prefixes
require a 64-bit host.

An infinite stream does not authorize an untrusted input to choose an
allocation. The config-backed public-matrix cache has an expected lineage and
requested minimum shape, so it is not governed by the generic self-describing
decode constant. Generic verifier-facing setup and commitment decoders retain
separately named allocation guards in this PR. Their long-term replacement is
a decode context that supplies expected identity, expected shape, and a host
byte budget before allocation.

Supporting ordinary 10 GB to 20 GB setup artifacts also requires paged,
streamed, or mapped storage. A larger covering cache should be able to serve a
smaller request without materializing its unused suffix. These storage and
context-aware decode changes are explicitly deferred. They are resource and
availability work, not changes to public-stream or proof semantics.

### Public-matrix derivation

#### Flat field stream

For a base field `F` and `AkitaSetupSeed id`, setup defines an infinite stream

```text
S_F,id[0], S_F,id[1], S_F,id[2], ...
```

The value at field index `i` MUST be independent of:

- any ring dimension used to view it;
- the requested materialization length;
- schedule level, matrix role, rows, or columns;
- config or planner policy;
- thread count and parallel execution order.

All A, B, and D matrices, including matrices used to commit a setup-prefix
object, are overlapping prefix views of this same stream. They are not assigned
disjoint role labels.

#### `Shake256PagedV1`

The first derivation algorithm is a fixed-page SHAKE256 construction. A page is
a derivation unit for deterministic parallelism, not a ring.

```text
PUBLIC_MATRIX_DOMAIN = "akita/commitment/public-field-stream"
DERIVATION_TAG       = "shake256-paged-v1"
PAGE_FIELD_ELEMENTS  = 4096

page(i)   = floor(i / PAGE_FIELD_ELEMENTS)
offset(i) = i mod PAGE_FIELD_ELEMENTS
```

`4096` is a fixed v1 policy constant, not a number derived from ring geometry.
A temporary local microbenchmark compared 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, and
16384 field elements per page over `2^23` outputs. On the measured machine,
4096 was the best fp128 candidate and remained near the fp32/fp64 throughput
plateau. Those measurements are machine-specific and are not expected to
establish a portable optimum. A fixed page size is required for deterministic
parallel derivation, and 4096 is a reasonable granularity, so v1 simply chooses
it and does not retain a permanent benchmark target. Changing the constant
requires another derivation variant and new golden vectors.

For each page index, initialize SHAKE256 and absorb the following values with
the repository's canonical length-prefixed encoding:

```text
("domain",     PUBLIC_MATRIX_DOMAIN)
("derivation", DERIVATION_TAG)
("page_field_elements", PAGE_FIELD_ELEMENTS as u64 little-endian)
("seed",       id.seed)
("field",      canonical 32-byte big-endian modulus of F)
("page",       page index as u64 little-endian)
```

Read field elements from the page XOF by calling `F::random`, whose
`RandomSampling` contract is strengthened by this cutover to mean the following
canonical exact-uniform sampler. Let
`b = ceil(log2(p))`, where `p` is the base-field modulus, and let
`n = ceil(b / 8)`. Read `n` bytes, interpret them as a little-endian integer,
clear the unused high bits above bit `b - 1`, and accept the integer exactly
when it is smaller than `p`; otherwise read another `n` bytes and retry. Map an
accepted integer to its canonical field representative. Repeat sequentially to
obtain exactly `PAGE_FIELD_ELEMENTS` elements. Then `S_F,id[i]` is the element
at `offset(i)` in that page. The final requested page MAY stop after the last
needed element.

This rejection sampler is both the protocol sampling rule for
`Shake256PagedV1` and the repository-wide meaning of `RandomSampling`.
`Fp32`, `Fp64`, and `Fp128` MUST share one canonical helper or equivalent
cross-checked implementations with identical byte-consumption semantics.
Extension-field implementations remain coefficient-wise calls to the uniform
base-field sampler. A future change to this algorithm requires a new public
matrix derivation variant even if the resulting distribution remains uniform.

The page constant is deliberately independent of every supported ring
dimension. Parallel derivation assigns pages to workers; the output is
concatenated in page-index order. A future change to the absorbed fields, page
size, XOF, or field sampling MUST introduce a new `PublicMatrixDerivation`
variant and descriptor version.

#### Prefix laws

For one `(F, id)`, derivation MUST satisfy:

```text
derive(n) == derive(m)[0..n]                for 0 <= n <= m
view(D1, r1, c1).flat == S[0..D1*r1*c1]
view(D2, r2, c2).flat == S[0..D2*r2*c2]
```

Changing only `D1` to `D2` changes grouping and multiplication semantics, but
it does not change any field coefficient at a shared flat index.

### Matrix capacity

#### One concrete schedule

For each concrete matrix use `u`, define:

```text
fields(u) = rows(u) * columns(u) * ring_dimension(u)
```

The public-matrix capacity required by a schedule is the maximum, not the sum:

```text
schedule_matrix_capacity = max(1, max_u fields(u))
```

The scan includes:

- root final-group A, B, and D matrices;
- every root precommitted group's A and B matrices;
- every recursive level's A, B, and D matrices;
- the terminal A matrix;
- A and B matrices used to commit every required setup-prefix slot.

All these matrices overlap at flat index zero. No role, group, level, chunk, or
ring dimension receives a disjoint allocation.

#### A provisioned setup package

A config-backed setup package may promise all schedules admitted by
`max_num_vars` and `max_num_batched_polys`. Its matrix capacity is the maximum
of `schedule_matrix_capacity` across that admitted schedule set and all
required preprocessing slot commitments.

The scan MUST operate on final, validated schedules. Planner estimates,
generated schedule rows, setup construction, and runtime validation MUST call
the same canonical field-count primitives. No path may convert the result
through a setup generation dimension.

The stored coefficient count SHOULD equal the exact computed maximum. A host
MAY deliberately materialize a larger prefix for future reuse, but that is an
explicit cache policy and MUST NOT change public matrix identity, proof bytes,
or schedule admissibility.

#### A schedule-scoped verifier setup

A prover package and a verifier hot path have different matrix requirements
when setup contributions are offloaded. The prover package must materialize
every source prefix and every matrix needed to build the setup-prefix
commitments. A verifier that has already accepted those commitment artifacts
does not scan an offloaded producer's full committed source prefix during proof
verification.

For a resolved schedule, number the nonterminal producers from the root through
the last recursive fold. Producer `i` is offloaded exactly when recursive
successor `i` carries `incoming_setup_prefix`. Define the schedule-scoped
verifier matrix requirement as:

```text
verifier_matrix_capacity = max(
    1,
    terminal A matrix fields,
    active setup fields for every non-offloaded producer
)
```

The opening layout for the root is the exact call layout. The opening layout
for a recursive producer consists of its witness group and, when present, its
incoming setup-prefix group. The latter uses the full-prefix domain. These
layouts and `active_setup_field_len` are canonical. Capacity code MUST NOT
reconstruct them with a second approximation.

This value is not generally “the second setup prefix.” There may be no
offloaded edge, one edge, or several edges. The terminal matrix may dominate,
and the first direct producer after the offloaded chain may require a different
prefix from every stored setup-prefix slot. The implementation therefore names
the value `verifier_setup_matrix_capacity_for_schedule` and returns the ordinary
`SetupMatrixCapacity` type.

`AkitaCommitmentScheme::setup_verifier_for_schedule` constructs this exact
slice. It retains the complete verifier setup-prefix registry, copies only the
required coefficient prefix, and records that shorter field count in the
expanded verifier setup. `setup_verifier` remains the full-package conversion
for callers that have not selected one schedule. Verification always checks
the selected schedule against the matrix actually present, so a schedule-scoped
package cannot silently verify a larger direct schedule.

The inherited `max_num_vars` and `max_num_batched_polys` remain provisioning
metadata. On a schedule-scoped verifier artifact they do not promise that the
shorter matrix covers every shape below those bounds. The concrete matrix
capacity and the role-specific verification check are authoritative.

For the shipped `nv=32` W8R2 multi-group schedule, the distinctions are:

| Quantity | Field elements |
|----------|---------------:|
| Config provisioning at `K=2` | 112,721,920 |
| Config provisioning at `K=4` | 225,443,840 |
| Exact schedule prover matrix maximum | 28,180,480 |
| First offloaded natural prefix | 28,180,480 |
| Second offloaded natural prefix | 20,447,232 |
| Schedule-scoped verifier matrix prefix | 10,223,616 |

The first two values are broad setup-construction envelopes. They are not the
matrix footprint of this exact generated row. The verifier value is smaller
than the second offloaded natural prefix because the proof hot path consumes
the stored commitment to that prefix rather than rederiving the prefix itself.
It still performs the first remaining direct setup scan and terminal matrix
check from the retained 10,223,616-field prefix.

This hot-path narrowing does not solve setup-prefix commitment provenance. A
setup installer that directly recomputes a 28,180,480-field commitment still
needs that source prefix while installing the package. A future certificate
chain may validate it from the 20,447,232-field commitment, then continue to
smaller commitments until a directly derived terminal prefix. That work belongs
to installation or first use, not per-proof verification. The verifier package
must retain the commitment registry and its future certificates even when its
hot-path public matrix is shorter.

### Setup-prefix offloading

Setup-prefix offloading has two lengths with different meanings:

```text
natural_len = active setup-weight support used by Stage 3
n_prefix    = next_power_of_two(max(1, natural_len))
```

The committed witness is:

```text
S[0..n_prefix]
```

Therefore:

- base public-matrix capacity MUST cover `n_prefix` for every materialized
  setup-prefix commitment;
- no coefficient in `S[0..n_prefix]` is synthesized as zero;
- the Boolean setup-index domain and setup-prefix commitment layout continue
  to use `n_prefix`;
- A/B matrices that commit the full-prefix object are ordinary matrix uses and their
  exact `rows * columns * D` footprints remain in capacity accounting;
- the setup-prefix group's inner A-matrix ring dimension determines how the
  full-prefix witness is chunked for commitment. It is a planner-owned commitment
  parameter, not a public-matrix generation dimension;
- the setup-prefix group's outer B-matrix dimension is selected independently,
  exactly like every other committed group's B matrix;
- neither `natural_len` nor the whole materialized setup must be divisible by
  the prefix A dimension. Only the full-prefix witness shape consumed by that
  commitment must be divisible by it.

A setup-prefix slot's semantic identity MUST bind the `AkitaSetupSeed`,
`natural_len`, padded-domain/commitment geometry, and commitment parameters.
The registry may avoid storing the ID redundantly when its enclosing setup
package already supplies and validates it.

This cutover does not reduce the setup-prefix polynomial from `n_prefix` to
`natural_len`. In a recursive suffix opening, the setup prefix remains its own
singleton polynomial group with `log2(n_prefix)` variables, while the recursive
witness remains a separate group with its own variable count. The multi-group
opening machinery MUST preserve those per-group arities; it MUST NOT physically
extend the setup group to the witness group's larger domain merely to batch
them. Therefore no new common-suffix padding is introduced, but the existing
setup-prefix tail contains actual public setup coefficients. The zero tail is
owned by the compact setup-index weight, not by the committed setup polynomial.

The former setup storage saving no longer applies to selected recursive
setup-prefix edges: deriving and storing the shared random matrix must cover
`n_prefix` source coefficients. Exact NTT-cache sizing can still remove
derived-state waste independently. Eliminating the remaining Boolean-domain
padding would require a separate non-power-of-two-domain protocol change.

The current restriction that recursive setup planning requires the base setup
to have been generated at D64 MUST be removed. Preprocessing a setup-prefix
commitment with planner-selected A/B dimensions over a flat source is valid
even when the same setup later supplies different dimensions to other protocol
matrices.

The prefix A dimension is not the producer's Stage 3 projection dimension and
is not required to equal the consumer witness group's A dimension. Stage 3
produces one flat field vector. The prefix commitment profile independently
chooses how that vector is chunked and committed; the subsequent fold shares
only the opening/ring-switch dimension required by its relation. A slot ID MUST
derive the prefix A dimension from its committed-group profile rather than
store a second `d_setup` field that can disagree with the profile.

### Transcript and protocol identity

The instance descriptor MUST separate algebra, public matrix identity, plan,
and call shape:

```text
AlgebraSection
    base field modulus
    message/protocol extension degrees

SetupSection
    digest(AkitaSetupSeed)
    decomposition, SIS, feature, and fold-bound policy

PlanSection
    digest(final effective schedule)
    -- includes every matrix's scheduled ring dimension and shape

CallSection
    claims and per-call public shape
```

`AlgebraSection` MUST NOT contain one global `ring_dimension_d`. There is no
single ring dimension for a mixed schedule. The effective schedule digest is
the sole owner of the A/B/D dimensions used by the proof.

The setup-bound digest MUST bind `AkitaSetupSeed`, not the serialized
materialization package. In particular it MUST NOT bind:

- materialized field-element capacity;
- `max_num_vars` or `max_num_batched_polys`;
- a setup cache path or config type;
- backend NTT cache state.

Consequently, the same proof is valid under any setup materialization that has
the same public matrix ID and covers every prefix required by its schedule.
Prover and verifier may use different covering capacities. They still derive
identical matrix coefficients and transcript bytes.

This cutover MUST bump `AKITA_INSTANCE_DESCRIPTOR_VERSION`. Old proofs and old
serialized setup caches are intentionally invalid.

### Schedule validation

Schedule validation MUST validate every distinct A/B/D ring dimension directly
against the field's protocol dispatch and CRT/NTT support. It MUST NOT validate
a schedule by requiring all dimensions to divide a global carrier dimension.

For each matrix, validation MUST check its own exact field footprint against
the materialized public prefix. A wider stored prefix can cover a smaller
request even when the wider prefix length is not divisible by the request's
ring dimension.

The planner's dimension search domain is an explicit set of supported matrix
dimensions. `setup_generation_dimension` and equivalent policy fields MUST be
removed. A maximum setup budget, when configured, is measured in base-field
elements or bytes.

Planner cost metrics remain separate because they answer different questions:

```text
setup fields       = reusable maximum public-matrix prefix
matrix work fields = additive matrix coefficients scanned across proof levels
NTT cache bytes    = execution-profile-specific resident derived state
proof bytes        = serialized proof payload
```

The planner MUST NOT use a ring-element setup proxy for any of them. A balanced
objective may compare or weight these metrics, but it must name an execution
profile before using NTT bytes because cluster aliasing and backend
representation affect that value. Generated schedule records SHOULD preserve
the protocol metrics needed to replay selection; benchmark reports may add
backend-specific NTT estimates without making them schedule identity.

### Exact NTT cache model

#### NTT caches are derived views

An NTT cache contains transforms of a public-matrix prefix. It is reproducible
from `PublicMatrixPrefix<F>` and does not belong to setup identity or setup
serialization.

The protocol uses at least these transform domains:

- **negacyclic** for A/B commitment products and the negacyclic half of A-side
  quotient work;
- **cyclic** for ring-switch D and B relations and the cyclic half of A
  quotient work;
- **exact negacyclic with optional i16 tail** for the terminal verifier;
- **compression diagnostic negacyclic** under the diagnostic feature, using
  its separate supported-dimension and profile policy.

These are not interchangeable cache modes. A request for one domain MUST NOT
force materialization of another domain.

#### Requirement unit

The canonical requirement unit is an exact prefix of ring elements at one
ring dimension:

```rust
pub struct NttPrefixRequirement {
    pub ring_dimension: usize,
    pub num_ring_elements: usize,
}
```

Transform domain, CRT profile, and operation cluster are keys around that
value, not booleans that force every vector in one cache object to have equal
length. Conceptually, one execution requirement set is:

```text
(cluster, D, profile) -> {
    negacyclic_prefix_rings,
    cyclic_prefix_rings,
    optional_i16_tail_prefix_rings,
}
```

The target implementation MAY use separate slot types or one per-D slot with
independent vectors. It MUST preserve independent prefix lengths.

The associated field footprint is always
`num_ring_elements * ring_dimension`. Every requested prefix is exactly
divisible by its own dimension; the containing public matrix need not be.

#### Requirement derivation

Every backend operation that consumes a public matrix MUST declare its exact
matrix prefix and transform domain from the same rows and active width passed
to the kernel. The implementation MUST have one canonical derivation path used
by prewarming, lazy cache acquisition, and tests. A prewarm planner
and the actual kernel call MUST NOT compute independent approximations.

The implementation realizes that contract as follows:

- `NttCacheKey::from_matrix_shape` is the sole rows/active-width derivation
  primitive used by both the execution compiler and lazy kernel acquisition;
- `NttExecutionRequirements::from_prove_schedule` compiles only work inside a
  `batched_prove` call. Prior root commitments are source- and backend-shaped
  separate API calls; `add_setup_prefix_commitment` likewise adds the
  independently invoked setup-prefix preprocessing call layout;
- `prewarm_ntt_requirements` routes each level through its selected
  `ProverComputeStack` cluster before transcript binding and max-joins retained
  requirements by process-local physical `NttCacheOwnerId`. This preserves
  real cache aliasing when several levels or clusters share one prepared setup.

The execution compiler first max-joins one `(level, cluster, D, domain)` route.
After routing, requirements that land on the same physical owner combine again
by `(owner, D, domain)` maximum:

```text
join(prefix_1, prefix_2, ...) = max(prefix_1, prefix_2, ...)
```

They do not sum because every matrix is an overlapping prefix of the same
stream. Different dimensions, domains, or physical owners remain separate.
Levels and clusters remain separate only when routing assigns them different
prepared owners; aliases of one prepared setup share one cache entry.

A requirement set is scoped to one API phase. Planned-versus-resident equality
therefore uses an initially empty owner or measures that phase's resident-state
delta. A cross-phase total requires a source- and backend-aware union; a
schedule alone cannot derive it because root source kernels differ in whether
their A path uses an NTT. `from_prove_schedule` MUST NOT charge a root
commitment that completed before the proof call.

The cache MUST support covering-prefix lookup: a slot of length `m` covers any
request `n <= m` with the same keys. Growth SHOULD transform only the missing
suffix. Replacement by a larger immutable snapshot is acceptable; an existing
borrower may finish on the older covering snapshot. Concurrent first use or
growth MUST be single-flight per cache key.
Failed initialization is not resident cache state. A failed cell MUST be
removed only when it is still the map entry for that key; callers that waited
on a failed covering cell retry their own exact request. Thus an oversized or
otherwise rejected warm cannot poison a later valid smaller prefix.

#### Operation clusters

`ProverComputeStack` permits commit, opening, tensor, and ring-switch clusters
to use different backends and prepared setups. NTT requirements MUST therefore
be routed to the cluster that actually executes the operation.

The implementation MUST NOT warm every role dimension on all four clusters.
A cluster with no NTT consumer has no NTT requirement. A uniform stack may
deduplicate identical requests naturally because its contexts share one
prepared setup; a heterogeneous stack must not pay for another cluster's
cache.

The cluster label is a routing coordinate, not necessarily a physical cache
identity. After routing, requirements whose contexts refer to the same prepared
cache owner are joined again by `(D, profile, domain)`. Requirements whose
contexts refer to different prepared objects remain separate even when their
backend types are equal. Memory reporting MUST account for this runtime
aliasing, so a uniform stack is counted once and four independent prepared
objects are counted four times.

At minimum, the compiler must account for:

- commit-cluster negacyclic prefixes for root, recursive, terminal, and
  setup-prefix A/B commitment products;
- ring-switch-cluster cyclic D/B prefixes and cyclic plus negacyclic A
  prefixes used by relation quotient construction;
- any opening-cluster digit-matrix operation that actually reads the public
  matrix;
- terminal verifier exact-negacyclic A prefixes and their independently sized
  i16 tail when the selected CRT profile requires it.

Tensor-only work does not acquire an NTT cache merely because it shares a
level with an NTT-consuming operation.

#### Base and tail profiles

Ordinary prover i8 and centered quotient kernels use the field/D-selected base
CRT profile. Their negacyclic and cyclic prefixes can have different lengths
while sharing immutable CRT parameters.

The terminal verifier remains an exact-negacyclic consumer. Its base prefix is
the exact terminal A footprint. Its i16 tail prefix exists only when
`ntt_cache_requires_i16_tail(width, rhs_abs_bound)` requires it and is independently
covering. The current verifier cache already approximates this target behavior
and should be generalized rather than replaced by a full-envelope cache.

Compression diagnostics remain a separate cache namespace. They MUST NOT
widen the ordinary protocol's ring-dimension support, profile, setup capacity,
or eager cache contract.

#### Memory formula

Let `K32(F, D)` be the number of i32 CRT primes in the portable base profile.
For one backend-owned `(cluster, D)` cache with `N` negacyclic ring entries,
`C` cyclic ring entries, and `T` i16-tail ring entries, portable transformed
matrix storage is:

```text
base bytes = (N + C) * D * K32(F, D) * sizeof(i32)
tail bytes = T * D * sizeof(i16)
total      = base bytes + tail bytes
```

Metadata and allocator overhead are reported separately if material.

For exact-negacyclic caches on AVX-512IFMA hosts at D64 through D512, replace
the base term with `N * D * K52(F) * sizeof(u64)`, where `K52` is 1, 2, or 3
for Q32, Q64, or Q128. The optional tail term is unchanged. Consequently,
profiling and verifier tests must obtain the selected representation's byte
count rather than assuming an i32 layout.

This formula is also the canonical estimator used by profiling. It makes the
current waste visible: preparing both domains over an `M`-field full envelope
costs `2 * M * K * sizeof(i32)` for each warmed dimension, even when that
dimension uses only a much smaller matrix prefix. Repeating the warm-up on
separate operation clusters repeats the allocation.

### Current implementation

The following behavior is the pre-cutover state that this follow-up must remove.

#### Derivation and setup shape

`AkitaSetupDescriptor` stores `gen_ring_dim` and `max_setup_len` in ring elements.
`derive_public_matrix_flat::<F, D>` starts one indexed XOF reader per ring
element and samples `D` coefficients from it. Thus the same seed at D64 and
D128 gives different coefficients after flat index 63. The function's flat
name does not make its output dimension-independent.

Current `Fp128::random` already uses exact rejection sampling. Current
`Fp32::random` reduces a 64-bit word modulo `p`, and `Fp64::random` reduces a
128-bit word modulo `p`; those distributions have negligible but nonzero bias.
The cutover fixes the trait semantics for all base fields instead of adding a
setup-only sampler with a competing meaning of field randomness.

`FlatMatrix` duplicates `gen_ring_dim`, requires its whole vector length to be
divisible by that dimension, and permits another D only when it divides the
generation D. `setup_matrix_envelope_for_schedule` takes the already correct
field count and converts it to
`ceil(field_count / gen_ring_dim)` ring elements. The materialized vector is
therefore rounded up to a generation-D boundary.

The seed digest in `AkitaInstanceDescriptor` binds the generation dimension,
capacity, and host nv/batch limits. `AlgebraSection` separately carries one
ring dimension even though the effective mixed schedule carries several.

#### Setup-prefix commitment domain

The setup-prefix witness is exactly `S[0..n_prefix]`. Every coefficient in the
power-of-two tail after `natural_len` is a real public-matrix coefficient and
is committed by the setup-prefix A/B matrices. The compact setup-index weight,
not the committed source, is zero outside `natural_len`.

Prefix preprocessing uses the prefix commitment's independently selected A/B
dimensions. It requires the block geometry to cover exactly `n_prefix / D_A`
rings and does not inherit a generation dimension from the flat setup stream.

#### Prover NTT caches

`NttCacheKey::from_envelope` reinterprets the entire setup vector at D.
`prepare_setup` eagerly builds one full-envelope slot at `gen_ring_dim`.
Subsequent mixed dimensions lazily build another full-envelope slot each.
Every ordinary slot uses `BothTransforms`, so cyclic and negacyclic arrays have
the same full length.

Before proving, every distinct role D at a level is warmed on commit, opening,
tensor, and ring-switch contexts. This is harmless when every context shares
one prepared CPU object, but wasteful for heterogeneous stacks and obscures
which operation owns each transform.

There is no general next-power-of-two rounding inside ordinary NTT preparation.
The large waste is full-setup coverage per D and equal-length dual domains.
Power-of-two lengths elsewhere belong to Boolean sumcheck, witness, or
setup-prefix commitment domains and must be reviewed individually rather than
removed indiscriminately.

### Feature interactions

#### Mixed ring dimensions

Each dimension gets its own matrix reshape and transform cache. There is no max
carrier, divisibility lattice, or setup-generation D. A schedule using A512,
B64, and D64 reads three role-specific prefixes from the same flat stream. The
D512 cache covers only D512 operations; the D64 cache covers the maximum of the
actual D64 consumers in each domain and cluster.

#### Multiple commitment groups

Root final and precommitted groups may have distinct A/B dimensions and
widths. Base matrix capacity is the maximum physical field footprint across all
their matrices. Cache requirements at an equal `(cluster, D, domain, profile)`
join by maximum. Group count never causes disjoint copies of the public matrix
or an additive NTT prefix.

#### Multiple witness chunks

Chunking changes final witness geometry and can therefore change scheduled
active widths. Requirements are compiled from those final widths. Once a
matrix shape is known, chunks reuse its public coefficients and transforms;
cache size is not multiplied by `num_chunks`.

One-hot polynomial storage also has single-chunk and multi-chunk kernel
representations. That storage choice changes how the input is traversed, not
the public A matrix. Both forms use the same scheduled active A width and the
same exact transform prefix. It must not create separate setup or NTT entries.

#### Extension openings and tensor work

Extension-opening reduction and tensor projection can change the schedule and
the base-field witness presented to later commitment operations. Those final
matrix shapes are counted normally. Tensor work that never reads the public
matrix creates no setup transform requirement, regardless of extension degree.
The public matrix itself is always over the base field.

#### Recursive folds and terminal verification

Every recursive level contributes its concrete A/B/D requirements. Equal keys
join by maximum across levels. The terminal contributes an A commitment
requirement to the prover commit cluster and an exact-negacyclic A requirement
to the verifier cache. These caches need not have the same profile or lifetime.

#### Setup offloading

The natural weight support, its complete power-of-two committed prefix, and the
matrices that commit that prefix are three separate shapes. Setup capacity and cache
compilation use the correct shape for each. Preprocessing caches may be dropped
after all required prefix slots are materialized; they must not silently become
the runtime prove-cache contract.

Direct Stage 3 evaluation views exactly the `required` natural ring rows. It
must not reinterpret the remainder of the materialized setup merely to obtain a
global `setup_eval_len`. An offloaded Stage 3 may separately use the padded
commitment domain because that domain is bound by its setup-prefix slot.

#### Disk persistence

Disk persistence stores a public matrix prefix and setup-prefix registries. It
does not store backend NTT caches.

The base-prefix cache lineage key is:

```text
(field modulus, AkitaSetupSeed)
```

Each artifact under that lineage records its exact materialized field count. A
validated artifact with a larger count may satisfy a smaller request because
the derivation is prefix-compatible. The derivation version is already inside
`AkitaSetupSeed`; config type names, schedule ring dimensions, and generation D
are not semantic cache keys. Provisioning limits and a schedule/catalog digest
MAY key or validate the derived setup-prefix registry because that registry
promises a particular set of precomputed slots.

The base-prefix artifact serializes only `AkitaSetupSeed`, the materialized
field count, and the flat coefficients. It does not serialize host admission
limits. A load reconstructs `max_num_vars` and `max_num_batched_polys` from the
current request while retaining any larger covering coefficient prefix. Thus a
covering cache cannot silently widen the setup package's admission contract.
Concurrent writers take the lineage lock, validate the resident artifact, and
replace it only when the candidate is a strict prefix extension. The resident
base prefix therefore forms a monotone max-join and cannot shrink under racing
small and large requests.

Before untrusted context-backed cache loading becomes a supported large-artifact
path, loading MUST validate all lengths against an expected shape or host
resource budget before allocation and verify that serialized coefficients
equal the deterministic flat stream. Validation SHOULD stream by page or
bounded chunk rather than allocate a second full expected matrix. The current
config-backed loader removes the stale generic 67,108,864-field ceiling, but
context-aware allocation and partial loading of larger covering artifacts
remain deferred as described above.
Writing SHOULD use an atomic temporary-file replacement. The cache namespace
MUST be bumped; old generation-D cache files are rejected and regenerated.

#### Parallel and no-default-feature builds

Parallelism changes only page scheduling and transform construction. It cannot
change coefficients, requirement joins, or cache keys. Builds without
`parallel` or `disk-persistence` use the same protocol identities and layouts.

#### Setup provisioning versus one execution

Two derived plans are intentionally different:

1. A **provisioning requirement** joins matrix capacity and required
   setup-prefix slot IDs across every schedule promised by host limits.
2. An **execution requirement** describes exact backend caches for one resolved
   schedule, call layout, and compute-stack routing.

Provisioning MUST NOT eagerly fill every NTT representation that any admitted
schedule might someday use. Execution prewarming MUST NOT rescan the entire
admitted schedule universe.

### Invariants

- Public coefficients are determined only by `(field, AkitaSetupSeed, flat
  index)`.
- The public stream has no protocol length ceiling. Resource limits belong to
  a host policy or a decode boundary.
- A larger materialization is a strict prefix extension of a smaller one.
- Matrix capacity, planner setup cost, and runtime coverage use base-field
  elements as their canonical unit.
- A matrix view validates only its own exact prefix; whole-vector divisibility
  is irrelevant.
- A/B/D role matrices overlap at flat index zero across roles, groups, levels,
  chunks, and dimensions.
- Setup-prefix inactive support is encoded in protocol weights, not by
  synthesizing committed zeros.
- Per-proof verification consumes validated setup state and never performs a
  large setup provenance check on its hot path.
- The effective schedule is the sole owner of protocol ring dimensions.
- Materialization capacity and backend cache state do not change proof or
  transcript bytes.
- NTT cache domains, profiles, dimensions, and operation clusters are explicit.
- Equal-key cache requirements join by maximum, never by sum.
- Prover and verifier derive identical coefficients and reject an undersized
  materialization before indexing or allocation.
- Verifier-reachable malformed shapes return `AkitaError` or
  `SerializationError`, never panic.

### Non-goals

- This spec does not change the packed overlapping-prefix A/B/D layout.
- It does not eliminate legitimate power-of-two Boolean domains.
- It does not serialize NTT caches or require a global eager prewarm.
- It does not change CRT prime selection or SIS security pricing, except that
  both consume schedule-local dimensions without a setup carrier.
- It does not require GPU and CPU caches to share an in-memory representation.
  They share requirement semantics and accounting units.
- It does not preserve old setup/proof/cache bytes.
- It does not by itself redesign `OneHotPoly` or every preset type. It does
  require removal of every use of a OneHot/config D as setup envelope identity.

## Evaluation

### Acceptance criteria

  generation D and can create any individually supported exact prefix view.
- [x] The canonical setup capacity type and all planner/generated estimates are
  measured in base-field elements.

  fp64, and fp128 implementations pass shared distribution/byte-consumption
  vectors.
- [x] A temporary page-size microbenchmark covered
  512/1024/2048/4096/8192/16384; `Shake256PagedV1` fixes 4096 as a policy

  the plan digest.
- [x] A proof generated with one materialized capacity verifies with a larger
  covering capacity having the same public matrix ID.

#### Setup-prefix offloading

- [x] Capacity accounting charges `n_prefix` for selected full-prefix setup
  sources and separately includes setup-prefix commitment matrices.
- [x] Tests cover a non-power-of-two natural support and prove tail entries are

- [x] Setup-prefix slot identity and registry validation are bound to the flat
  public matrix identity and exact natural/full-prefix geometry.

  full-envelope key constructor.
- [x] Negacyclic, cyclic, and optional i16-tail prefixes can have independent
  lengths.
- [x] Prewarming routes requirements only to clusters that consume them.

  identical public stream coefficients.
- [x] The fp128 one-hot nv36 mixed-dimension CI benches run through production
  schedule resolution, prewarms the exact shared-owner commit-and-prove union
  in its preparation phase, rejects online cache growth, and reports exact
  setup fields plus per-D/domain/cluster NTT bytes for direct and recursive
  setup contribution.
- [x] No setup code uses a config/preset D or `D512OneHot` as public-matrix
  identity or allocation unit.

#### Documentation and quality

- [x] The setup and caching section of the Akita Book is updated from this spec
  once the cutover is implemented.
- [x] Scoped revision notes in older specs point here for setup derivation and
  NTT-cache semantics while preserving their unrelated decisions.
- [x] No thin wrapper preserves the removed generation-D API.
- [x] `./scripts/check-doc-guardrails.sh` and every repository preflight command
  required by touched paths pass.

The checklist above records the flat setup and cache cutover. The broader
testing matrix below is a durable target for all field widths and protocol
compositions, not a claim that PR341 ships every combination. In this PR the
mixed-dimension catalog coverage is the scalar fp128 nv32 one-hot family;
mixed multi-group replay, mixed multi-chunk planning, and fp32/fp64 mixed
catalogs remain deferred to the mixed-planner follow-up.

### Testing strategy

#### Derivation tests

Use at least fp32, fp64, and fp128 fields. For each field:

- compare serial and parallel derivation byte-for-byte;
- derive lengths before, at, and after a page boundary;
- prove prefix extension for several capacities;
- view overlapping prefixes at D32, D64, D128, D256, and D512 where supported;
- verify that flat coefficients are unchanged across those views;
- mutate seed, derivation variant, field modulus, and page index independently
  and confirm domain separation;
- round-trip and validate serialized materializations without a generation D.

Golden vectors MUST cover page zero, the last element of page zero, and the
first element of page one. They make accidental sampling or encoding changes
review-visible.

#### Capacity tests

Construct schedules where the largest footprints come respectively from root
A, root B, root D, a precommitted group, a recursive level, terminal A, a
setup-prefix full source, and a setup-prefix commitment matrix. Assert that
the canonical scan returns the exact maximum in fields.

Include a maximum whose field count is not divisible by another scheduled D.
That schedule must remain valid because each requested matrix prefix is itself
well-shaped.

#### NTT requirement tests

Build table-driven expected requirement maps for:

- uniform-D scalar setup;
- A512/B64/D64 mixed root;
- mixed dimensions across levels;
- multi-group root with unequal group dimensions and widths;
- two and four witness chunks;
- one and multiple setup-offloaded levels;
- terminal verifier with and without an i16 tail;
- uniform and heterogeneous compute stacks;
- compression diagnostics enabled and disabled.

For each map, assert exact keys, independent domain lengths, maximum joins, and
reported bytes. Kernel tests must additionally prove that every planned prefix
covers the actual indices read. A test-only recording backend SHOULD compare
declared requirements with observed matrix reads so future kernels cannot
silently bypass the compiler.

#### End-to-end tests

Run commit/prove/verify for the production fp128 nv36 one-hot mixed-dimension
schedule in both direct and recursive setup modes. Run the same proof with
different covering materialization capacities. Exercise multi-group and
multi-chunk layouts together because their interaction is the easiest place
to accidentally sum overlapping prefixes or duplicate caches.

Malformed verifier tests cover zero/overflowing dimensions, overflowing
row-width products, insufficient field prefixes, wrong public matrix IDs,
wrong setup-prefix geometry, and serialized length bombs.

### Performance

The cutover has three required measurements:

1. coefficient-form setup bytes;
2. peak and resident NTT bytes broken down by operation cluster, D, transform
   domain, and profile;
3. setup derivation, prefix preprocessing, commit, prove, and verify time.

The direct and recursive fp128 one-hot nv36 mixed-dimension CI benches are the
primary regression fixtures. Their reports MUST show both the provisioned
setup requirement and the concrete execution-cache requirement. A single
aggregate `setup_ring_elements` number is insufficient.

Expected direction:

- setup coefficient bytes do not increase and normally decrease by removing
  generation-D rounding and padded-source charging;
- NTT bytes decrease materially because each D transforms only its largest
  actual prefix and only in required domains/clusters;
- XOF setup generation should remain parallel and within a small constant
  factor of the current implementation; page-level parallelism must avoid one
  SHAKE initialization per field;
- proof size and security parameters do not change solely because of cache
  refactoring, although proof bytes intentionally change with the new public
  matrix and descriptor version.

Any regression in resident NTT bytes for the nv32 mixed fixture is a merge
blocker unless the report identifies a newly covered real operation and the PR
documents the tradeoff.

## Design

### Architecture

The canonical dataflow is:

```text
host limits + config/catalog
        |
        | enumerate promised final schedules
        v
compile provisioning requirements
        |-- exact max public-matrix fields
        `-- required setup-prefix slot identities
        |
        v
derive/load PublicMatrixPrefix<F>
        |
        | exact full-prefix coefficients
        +---------------------> setup-prefix preprocessing
        |                           | active support in setup-index weights
        |                           `-> persistent slot registries
        |
resolved schedule + call + compute-stack routing
        |
        v
compile execution requirements
        |-- commit cluster: exact neg prefixes
        |-- ring-switch cluster: exact neg/cyc prefixes
        |-- other clusters: only declared consumers
        `-- verifier terminal: exact neg + optional tail
        |
        v
backend-local lazy/prewarmed cache slots
```

The schedule remains the source of matrix ranks, widths, and dimensions. The
setup requirement compiler is a pure consumer of those shapes. The backend is
a consumer of compiled exact prefix requests. Neither setup nor backend may
invent protocol geometry.

### Canonical joins

Provisioning joins and execution joins are small algebraic operations and
SHOULD be represented as such:

```text
matrix capacity: max(field prefixes)
slot registry:   set union(slot IDs)
NTT prefix:      pointwise max by full cache key
```

These joins are associative, commutative, and idempotent. Tests SHOULD assert
those laws. This gives multi-group, multi-chunk, and multi-level composition a
single answer without feature-specific conditionals.

### API boundaries

`akita-types` owns:

- public matrix identity and flat derivation;
- dimension-free prefix storage and checked matrix views;
- canonical setup-capacity and setup-prefix geometry primitives;
- cache requirement value types and schedule-shape joins that are backend
  independent;
- descriptor serialization and validation.

`akita-config` and `akita-planner` own:

- the admitted schedule universe for host limits;
- exact field-based capacity budgets and scoring;
- production generated schedule data;
- no setup generation dimension.

`akita-setup` owns:

- provisioning scans;
- loading/generating an exact public prefix;
- setup-prefix preprocessing and registry persistence;
- cache namespace/version and strict load validation.

`akita-prover` owns:

- routing execution requirements to concrete compute clusters;
- backend-local transform preparation and covering-prefix lookup;
- operation plans whose exact rows/widths agree with requirement derivation.

`akita-verifier` owns:

- exact direct setup scans;
- exact terminal NTT requests;
- no-panic validation before views and allocations.

### Alternatives considered

#### Keep a maximum generation D

Rejected. A max D is neither matrix identity nor useful physical storage
metadata. It changes XOF coefficients, imposes false divisibility constraints,
rounds capacity, and makes mixed schedules look subordinate to one carrier.

#### Generate at D1 or one field element per XOF

Generating one field per indexed XOF is dimension-independent but pays one
SHAKE initialization per coefficient. A fixed field page preserves parallelism
and prefix compatibility without smuggling ring geometry back into derivation.

#### One sequential XOF for the whole stream

This gives clean prefix semantics but prevents deterministic random-access page
derivation and practical parallel setup generation. Fixed indexed pages retain
both properties.

#### Round materialization to the largest supported D

Rejected as a semantic contract. A host may overallocate deliberately, but
rounding is not needed for any exact matrix view and cannot affect identity or
validation.

#### One NTT slot per D with both equal-length domains

Rejected. It is simpler locally but systematically doubles single-domain uses
and promotes the largest domain prefix to every representation. Independent
covering prefixes express the actual kernel contracts.

#### Build cache entries only lazily without a requirement compiler

Rejected as the sole design. Lazy construction is useful, but without a
declarative requirement set setup sizing, prewarming, memory estimates, and
kernel use drift apart. The same canonical derivation must support both lazy
checks and optional prewarm.

#### Precompute every cache admitted by setup limits

Rejected. Provisioning and execution have different lifetimes. A setup may
cover many schedules while one proof uses exactly one. NTT caches belong to
the latter.

## Documentation

During implementation, `book/src/usage/commitment-api.md` becomes the durable
narrative for public matrix identity, setup provisioning, setup-prefix
offloading, persistence, and cache lifetime. It should explain the four-layer
model without reproducing every cache key.

`book/src/how/architecture.md` should state that ring dimensions are
schedule-owned views and that public setup has no ring dimension. Detailed NTT
cache formulas and acceptance history stay in this spec until the cutover is
stable, then the durable parts are folded into the book and this spec is
archived according to `specs/PRUNING.md`.

The scoped revision authority of these live specs must point here:

- `specs/archive/2026-Q3/setup-layout-repack.md`: packed overlapping prefixes remain; flat
  field derivation and capacity semantics move here;
- `specs/runtime-ring-cutover.md`: runtime schedule ownership remains;
  generation-D setup and full-envelope NTT phase-1 contracts move here;
- the deleted mixed-ring experiment: planner and mixed-D evidence is now covered
  by `specs/role-native-projected-digit-layout.md`;
  setup carrier and cache semantics move here.

## Execution

This follow-up should implement the cutover in dependency order without compatibility
wrappers.

1. Add flat public matrix identity, paged derivation, golden vectors, and exact
   prefix storage in `akita-types`; use `jolt-field`'s canonical field sampling
   helper for every prime field.
2. Cut checked matrix views and canonical field-capacity scans to the new
   storage. Remove whole-envelope ring reinterpretation.
3. Change descriptor identity and version, then update prover/verifier
   transcript construction together.
4. Remove setup generation D from config, planner policies, generated rows,
   estimates, examples, profile output, and schedule validation.
5. Change `akita-setup` provisioning, serialization, disk keys, and streamed
   validation. Invalidate old cache files.
6. Correct setup-prefix source capacity to natural length, remove the D64 base
   setup restriction, make prefix A/B dimensions planner-owned commitment
   parameters, remove duplicate `d_setup` identity, and keep explicit zero
   padding.
7. Introduce canonical execution requirements and independent-domain covering
   cache slots. Cut kernels and prewarming to exact requests.
8. Route requirements per compute cluster and preserve the exact terminal
   verifier/compression namespaces.
9. Add cross-feature end-to-end and memory-accounting tests, wire the nv32
   production mixed schedule into the CI bench, and update generated tables.
10. Fold the stable explanation into the book, update spec statuses, and run
    the complete repository preflight.

The implementation should delete obsolete generation-D helpers and tests as
their call sites are migrated. It must not retain `_flat_v2`, `_for_dimension`,
or pass-through aliases that recreate the old API.
