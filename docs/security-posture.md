# Akita Security Posture

This document records the security boundaries that reviewers should keep in mind when changing Akita.
It is not a substitute for a third-party audit.

## Trust Boundaries

Akita has three main trust boundaries:

- Verifier-facing proof and setup bytes may be attacker controlled.
- Prover witnesses and intermediate polynomials may contain private application data.
- Build inputs, Git dependencies, and GitHub Actions influence the binary that users run.

Validated deserialization is the default for bytes that cross a trust boundary.
Unchecked deserialization is reserved for internal buffers whose producer and shape have already been validated in the same trust domain.

## Verifier No-Panic Boundary

Verifier-facing execution must be panic-free for malformed public inputs.
Public proofs, setup artifacts, schedules, fold parameters, opening points, commitments, claim incidence summaries, direct witnesses, and transcript data must be rejected with `AkitaError` or `SerializationError` rather than `panic!`, assertions, unchecked indexing, arithmetic overflow, or unbounded allocation.

Verifier-reachable helpers may remain infallible only when a prior boundary has established the required invariant.
That validation should live at deserialization, setup validation, schedule selection, verifier API entry, or prepared-state construction.
Hot verifier arithmetic paths should not grow fallback evaluators or repeated defensive checks when a single boundary check can preserve the existing execution model.

## Soundness-Critical Surfaces

Reviewers should treat these changes as security-sensitive:

- verifier acceptance logic,
- verifier input validation or any verifier-reachable panic-shaped operation,
- Fiat-Shamir domain labels, transcript order, or challenge derivation,
- canonical field, ring, proof, setup, and claim serialization,
- crate dependency edges into verifier-facing crates,
- configuration schedules that determine proof shape,
- unsafe field, algebra, NTT, or matrix kernels,
- dependency, toolchain, or CI changes.

## Unsafe Code Policy

Unsafe code is allowed only where it buys concrete performance or layout control that safe Rust cannot express cleanly.
Every unsafe block should have a local safety argument that names the invariant being relied on.
Verifier-facing crates should avoid unsafe code unless a spec explicitly justifies it.

## Resource Limits

Verifier-facing decoding must not allocate solely from attacker-provided lengths without an explicit bound.
When a proof shape already determines a length, prefer shape-derived allocation over self-described vector lengths.
Validated proof-shape decoding must reject shape dimensions that exceed the generic verifier-facing allocation cap before allocating shape-controlled buffers.

## Current Assurance

Akita currently relies on strict Rust CI, crate-boundary checks, specs for large protocol changes, and targeted tests.
The hardening roadmap adds supply-chain checks, fuzzing, property tests, bounded untrusted decoding, and clearer unsafe and panic discipline.

## Prepared Catalog Codec

Prepared binary schedule catalogs use pinned bincode 2.0.1. The exception for
[RUSTSEC-2025-0141](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2025-0141) accepts its
unmaintained status to preserve the existing binary format; it does not resolve
the advisory or establish that the codec is free of defects. Other advisory and
yanked-dependency checks remain enabled.

`from_trusted_artifact_binary` accepts catalogs from the application's trusted
setup path. Both binary decoders enforce the 64 MiB byte/decode limit, exact
consumption, format and configuration binding, and shared semantic row validation.
Selected catalogs also validate their ordered identities and available-row
membership. These checks do not authenticate the artifact's provenance; the
application supplies that authority.

Replacing the codec requires a format-version decision, compatibility or explicit
conversion tests, malformed/trailing/oversized artifact controls, and replay of
preserved trusted artifacts. A maintenance exception is not a substitute for that
migration work.
