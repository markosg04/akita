# Setup and prepared compute state

Akita uses transparent public setup. The setup contains no secret trapdoor and
needs no ceremony. A deployment can generate it from the public setup seed,
store it for reuse, and derive a smaller verifier package for each supported
proof shape.

The API separates protocol identity from local compute state. This lets a host
cache expensive transforms without changing commitments or proof bytes.

## The four setup objects

| Object | What it means | Can local copies differ? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AkitaSetupSeed` | Identity of the deterministic public matrix stream | No |
| Prover setup capacity | How much of that stream the prover materialized | Yes, if every proof requirement is covered |
| Setup prefix registry | Public commitments used by recursive setup offloading | It must cover the same supported schedules |
| Prepared backend state | Local transformed matrix prefixes and compute resources | Yes |

The public matrix stream has one identity across ring dimensions. A trusted
schedule row takes the exact widths and dimensions needed by each operation from
a prefix of that stream.

The current identity is `Shake256PagedV1`: independently derived 4096-element
SHAKE256 pages followed by exact field rejection sampling. [Setup and
commitment](../how/commitment.md#exact-public-stream-derivation) gives the byte
encoding. A host that regenerates setup must use that versioned derivation,
not an application-specific PRG expansion of the 32-byte seed.

## Build prover setup once

The normal entry point takes the largest number of variables and largest total
polynomial count across the final and all precommitted groups in one opening
batch that the host plans to support.

```rust
let catalog = TrustedScheduleCatalog::<Config>::from_artifact_bytes(&artifact_bytes)?;
let scheme = AkitaCommitmentScheme::<Config>::new(catalog);
let setup = scheme.setup_prover(
    max_num_vars,
    max_total_batched_polys,
)?;
```

A larger covering setup can serve a smaller proof under the same public seed.
The commitment and proof bind the public setup identity, not the amount of
matrix data that one prover happened to store.

For a recursive configuration, setup construction also prepares the setup
prefix commitments required by its supplied catalog. The host should build
setup with the configuration that will produce the final proofs.

## Prepare the compute backend

The CPU backend turns public setup into reusable execution state.

```rust
let backend = CpuBackend::DEFAULT;
let prepared = backend.prepare_setup(&setup)?;
let stack = UniformProverStack::uniform(
    &backend,
    &prepared,
    setup.expanded.as_ref(),
)?;
```

The prepared state starts with empty transform caches. Commitment and proving
kernels build exact entries as needed. A larger cached prefix can serve a
smaller request with the same field, ring dimension, and transform domain.

These caches are derived from a matrix view. They are not part of the public
stream and are not covered by `AkitaSetupSeed`. Two machines may retain
different transform domains and prefix lengths while producing identical
commitments and proofs.

Keep `backend`, `prepared`, and `stack` alive across repeated work. This makes
later commitments and proofs reuse the matrix transforms already built by the
first one.

## Build verifier setup

The simplest conversion keeps the complete materialized public matrix prefix.

```rust
let verifier_setup = scheme.setup_verifier(&setup)?;
```

This is a good starting point for local verification and the first integration.

A deployment that knows the exact proof schedule can derive a smaller verifier
setup:

```rust
let resolved = scheme.schedules().resolve_selection(selection)?;
let opening_layout = verifier_claims.committed_layout()?;
let verifier_setup =
    scheme.setup_verifier_for_schedule(
        &setup,
        resolved.schedule(),
        &opening_layout,
    )?;
```

The narrowed setup retains the terminal matrix and every public matrix prefix
that verification still reads directly. A setup contribution carried by a
recursive setup proof does not need the same direct prefix in the verifier hot
path.

The complete setup prefix commitment registry remains part of verifier setup.
Those commitments authenticate the offloaded public setup contributions.

## Reuse and release CPU caches

Prepared state stays warm by default. That is the right policy for a service
that proves many statements with the same setup.

Some hosts need to lower peak memory between the root commitment and later
folds. `ReleaseRootNttAfterFold` wraps a prover stack and releases large shared
matrix transform entries after the root fold. The entries rebuild when a later
proof needs them again.

The release policy changes local memory and compute time. It does not change
setup identity, commitment identity, or proof bytes. Measure the complete host
before choosing it.

## Disk persistence

The `disk-persistence` feature stores public matrix coefficients and setup
prefix artifacts. It does not store backend transform caches.

Stored setup entries include their public identity and provisioning limits.
Versioned filenames prevent an older setup format from being accepted as a
current entry. If a cache entry is missing or invalid, Akita can regenerate the
public data from the seed.

A deployment that distributes verifier setup should authenticate the package
or regenerate it from the public seed. This gives every verifier the same
public setup identity while allowing each machine to choose its own local
storage and compute caches.

## Setup offloading

Recursive setup offloading commits to an actual power of two prefix of the
public matrix stream. The prefix may be longer than the active setup weight.
The extra coefficients are still real public setup data, while the weight is
zero outside its natural support.

The planner chooses the commitment parameters for that prefix independently of
the fold that produced or consumed it. The
[setup offloading chapter](../how/setup-offloading.md) explains this lifecycle
from planning through verifier replay.

## Operational rule

Share protocol identity and choose compute state locally.

- Prover and verifier packages must agree on the setup seed and prefix
  commitments.
- A prover may materialize a larger covering matrix prefix.
- Each machine may build its own prepared transform caches.
- Cache release and persistence policies may follow the host's measured memory
  budget.

The [profiling guide](./profiling.md) reports setup size and prepared cache size
separately so these costs remain visible.
