# NTT, CRT, and fast ring arithmetic

> **Status:** current narrative. This page documents the implemented CRT and NTT paths, including the AVX-512IFMA exact cache.

Akita computes ring products by mapping each ring to several smaller prime
fields. It performs a negacyclic NTT in each field, multiplies matching
evaluations, applies an inverse NTT, and reconstructs the centered result with
the Chinese remainder theorem. The same representation supports matrix
matvecs over balanced signed digits.

The protocol fields and the CRT fields have different jobs. Protocol values
live in the pseudo-Mersenne fields described in [Field
arithmetic](./field-arithmetic.md). The smaller CRT primes are auxiliary
compute fields chosen to provide roots of unity for each active ring degree.
They do not change the statement being proved.

## Deferred reduction and balanced digits

The commitment matvec first decomposes field coefficients into balanced base
\(2^L\) digits. A digit has the exact interval

\[
[-2^{L-1}, 2^{L-1}-1].
\]

Bases through \(L=8\) fit in `i8`. Bases from \(L=9\) through \(L=16\) fit
in `i16`. The NTT cache selector receives the resulting absolute coefficient
bound directly. It does not infer the bound from a label such as `L10`.

**Code:** `crates/akita-algebra/src/ring/cyclotomic/decomposition.rs` and
`crates/akita-types/src/ntt_cache/`.

## CRT and NTT representation

For a ring of degree \(D\), each CRT prime supplies a primitive root of order
\(2D\). The forward transform multiplies by the negacyclic twist and then
performs a decimation in frequency transform. The inverse performs the inverse
decimation in time stages, applies the inverse scale, and removes the twist.
The forward and inverse order avoids a separate bit reversal.

The ordinary production profiles use 30 bit CRT primes stored in `i32` limbs:

| Field tier | CRT primes | Base representation |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Q32 | 2 | 2 `i32` residues |
| Q64 | 3 | 3 `i32` residues |
| Q128 | 6 | 6 `i32` residues |

The pointwise products and inverse transforms run independently for each CRT
prime. Garner reconstruction then combines the residues into the protocol
field. The optional prime 12289 is an exactness tail. It supports every
protocol ring degree through `D = 2048` and is added only when the base CRT
product does not meet the requested bound.

## What AVX-512 means in the current implementation

Akita has two different AVX-512 paths. They must not be described as one
backend.

The ordinary i32 NTT path uses the scalar reference implementation or the
runtime selected AVX2 implementation on x86. `AKITA_SCALAR_NTT=1` forces the
scalar path. A width aware AVX-512 i32 transform also exists. It uses 16 i32
lanes on stages with a half length of at least 16, 8 lanes at half length 8,
4 lanes at half length 4, and scalar work for the remaining small stages.
Production runtime dispatch does not select this wide i32 transform. It is
kept for direct architecture tests and benchmark experiments because the
measured AVX2 transform is faster on the target workloads.

The second path is AVX-512IFMA. It is used for exact signed NTT caches,
including selected dense q128 commitments whose digits fit in `i8`. The
selector enables it only when all of the following hold:

- the process has `avx512f`, `avx512dq`, and `avx512ifma`;
- `AKITA_SCALAR_NTT` is not set to `1`;
- the ring degree is `D64` through `D2048`; and
- the exact cache request can be represented by the selected IFMA CRT
  product, with an optional exactness tail where that profile supports one.

The IFMA kernels use 512 bit vectors with eight `u64` lanes. The instruction
family uses a 52 bit radix internally. The selected CRT primes are each below
\(2^{50}\), so the stored canonical residues are 50 bit values. They are NTT
primes, not the protocol field moduli:

| Prime | Value | Distance below \(2^{50}\) |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| \(p_0\) | `1125899906826241` | `16383` |
| \(p_1\) | `1125899906629633` | `212991` |
| \(p_2\) | `1125899905744897` | `1097727` |

The exact cache uses the smallest CRT representation that meets the strict CRT bound:

| Field tier | IFMA residues | IFMA selection rule |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Q32 | 1 `u64` residue | Use the base residue when it fits. Add 12289 when the base does not fit but the mixed product does. Otherwise use the ordinary Q32 profile. |
| Q64 | 2 `u64` residues | Use the IFMA form only when the two base residues fit. Otherwise use the ordinary Q64 profile, which can add 12289. |
| Q128 | 3 `u64` residues | Use the base residues when they fit. Add the 30-bit prime 1073707009 when the hybrid product fits. Otherwise use the ordinary Q128 profile. |

For the full signed `i16` bound, the one prime Q32 base is not sufficient at
the eligible degrees, so Q32 exact caches use the mixed tail. The two prime Q64
base supports much larger widths without a tail. The three-prime Q128 base is
roughly 150 bits; its optional 30-bit tail raises the exact reach to roughly
180 bits, matching the portable six-prime profile. This is why one
AVX-512IFMA host can use different cache representations for different field
and schedule shapes.

This representation is used by `ExactNegacyclic` cache requests. Ordinary
`Negacyclic`, `Cyclic`, and `BothTransforms` requests use the selected i32
profile. The exact selector uses the field modulus, ring degree, matrix width,
and signed RHS bound. It does not select IFMA merely because the host has
AVX-512.

Dense q128 commitments add one further performance rule. If the complete row
exceeds the three-prime IFMA capacity but fits after adding 1073707009, an eligible
AVX-512IFMA host accumulates the row exactly. This avoids repeatedly
transforming and reconstructing many small chunks. Scalar, AVX2, and NEON
hosts keep the chunked `i8` path, which is faster and uses less prepared-cache
memory on those architectures. The rule depends on CPU capability and the
capacity bound, not on a machine name or a fixed problem size.

The IFMA matrix stores one transformed negacyclic matrix for each selected
50 bit prime. When a Q128 tail is needed, the cache stores a shorter prefix of
the same matrix under the 30 bit prime 1073707009. The matvec transforms the signed
`i16` RHS, accumulates pointwise products, reconstructs with all selected
residues, and returns canonical protocol field elements. The tail does not
change setup bytes, proof bytes, transcript bytes, or setup digests.

`crates/akita-algebra/src/ntt/ifma52/x86.rs`,
`crates/akita-types/src/ntt_cache/exact.rs`, and
`crates/akita-algebra/src/ntt/avx/wide512.rs`.

## Accumulation capacity and chunking

Let `q` be the protocol field modulus, `D` the ring degree, `W` the number of
matrix columns accumulated before reconstruction, `B` the maximum absolute
value of a signed RHS coefficient, and `P` the product of the active CRT
primes. Each output coefficient is a signed sum of at most `D` products per
matrix column. The strict condition for centered reconstruction is

```text
2 * W * D * floor(q / 2) * B < P
```

If the base product does not satisfy this condition, exact preparation adds
the 12289 tail when the combined product does satisfy it. If neither product
is sufficient, preparation rejects the request. The same capacity calculation
is used by cache preparation, verifier warming, runtime matvec checks, and
tests.

Large matrix operations can split their work into chunks and reconstruct after
each chunk. This keeps every intermediate result inside the same bound. The
cache key records the ring degree, transform domain, and required prefix. A
stronger exact request can retain a tail prefix for a later weaker request.

On portable, AVX2, and NEON hosts, exact caches use the field selected i32
profile and add the 12289 tail when needed. On eligible AVX-512IFMA hosts, the
selector may use the 50 bit u64 profiles described above. These are different
storage choices for the same centered CRT contract.

`docs/crt-ntt-capacity-profile.md`.

## Smooth-subgroup FFT for Reed--Solomon encoding

The CRT transforms above accelerate multiplication in
\(\mathbb F_q[X]/(X^D+1)\). Reed--Solomon encoding is a different operation:
it evaluates a polynomial at many points in the protocol field itself.

The production `fp128` modulus

\[
q=2^{128}-2^{32}+22537
\]

was chosen in part because \(q-1\) contains the smooth factor

\[
17496=2^3\cdot 3^7.
\]

`primitive_nth_root::<F>(n)` checks that `n` is positive and divides the
configured smooth subgroup order, then derives a root of order `n` from the
field's configured generator. Invalid requests panic.

`SmoothDomain::new(omega, n)` takes that caller-supplied root and size, factors
the size, and precomputes the execution plan. Its primitivity check is a debug
assertion; it does not provide production validation of an arbitrary supplied
root. Construction can panic, including when `omega` is zero or `n` is not
invertible in the field.

Other protocol fields do not implement `SmoothFftField` merely because they are
pseudo-Mersenne fields.

### Iterative mixed-radix execution

For

\[
n=f_0f_1\cdots f_{s-1},
\qquad f_i\in\{2,3,5,7\},
\]

the forward transform first applies the mixed-radix analogue of bit reversal.
It then sweeps the stages from small to large, running an in-place radix-
\(f_i\) butterfly at each stage. The inverse uses inverse roots and multiplies
the result by \(n^{-1}\).

The domain precomputes both digit-reversal positions and stage twiddles.
Repeated encoding therefore performs no factorization, root search, or
per-stage allocation. A reusable workspace holds the two transform buffers.

### Small-radix kernels

Each butterfly has a specialized kernel. Radix 2 is the ordinary sum and
difference. Radix 3 uses \(1+\omega+\omega^2=0\) to reduce the number of
field multiplications. Radix 5 and radix 7 use precomputed Winograd constants
and fixed addition chains instead of a dense quadratic-size DFT.

The configured `fp128` subgroup uses only radices 2 and 3. Radix-5 and radix-7
kernels are implemented, but the current tests do not exercise them. Direct-DFT
comparisons cover the selected sizes 2, 3, 6, 8, 9, 18, 24, 27, 54, 81, 162,
243, 486, and 729. Separate tests check root orders at selected sizes through
17496, forward/inverse round trips at 243, 1458, and 2187, and coset extension
from 243 to 2187. These checks do not establish parity for every subgroup
divisor.

### Coset extension

Suppose evaluations are known on a subgroup of size \(k\), and the target
Reed--Solomon domain has size \(kB\). The implementation first applies the
inverse size-\(k\) transform to recover coefficients. For each of the remaining
\(B-1\) cosets, it multiplies coefficient \(i\) by a coset shift raised to
\(i\), then applies the forward size-\(k\) transform. The output is stored in
coset-major order.

This flow reuses one `SmoothDomain` and one workspace across all cosets. It
returns only the `k(B-1)` evaluations on the additional cosets; the original
subgroup evaluations are not repeated. The smooth FFT and Reed--Solomon
extension are exported arithmetic utilities currently exercised by unit tests
and `crates/akita-pcs/benches/fft_smooth.rs`. The production prover and verifier
do not call this encoding path.

**Code:** `crates/akita-algebra/src/fft.rs`.
